# 🛡️ AI-Driven MXDR System

> An intelligent Managed Extended Detection and Response (MXDR) system using AI to detect unknown threats, correlate multi-IP attacks, and reduce alert fatigue.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds a next-generation AI-based MXDR system that can:
- 🤖 Think like an attacker and predict their next moves
- 🔍 Detect unknown threats never seen before
- 🔗 Correlate attacks across multiple IP addresses
- 📚 Learn from analyst feedback and improve over time
- 📊 Reduce alert fatigue by 90%

### Key Features

1. **Autonomous Threat Hypothesis Reasoning (ATHR)** - AI predicts attacker next moves
2. **Context-Aware Multi-IP Correlation Engine (CA-MICE)** - Connects distributed attacks
3. **Adaptive Log Compression** - Reduces storage by 90% while preserving context
4. **Self-Optimizing Threat Models (SOTM)** - Learns from analyst feedback
5. **Zero-Shot Unknown Malware Detection** - Detects never-before-seen threats
