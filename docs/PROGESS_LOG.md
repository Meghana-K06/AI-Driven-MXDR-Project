## Week 1: Foundation & Project 0

### Day 0 - January 19, 2026 ✅

**Project Phase:** Project 0 - Understanding the Problem

**What I Did:**
- Read project documentation
- Understood MXDR concepts (smart security system)
- Learned about alert fatigue problem
- Learned what logs are and why they matter
- Created GitHub repository
- Wrote PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md in my own words

**What I Learned:**
- **MXDR** = Managed Extended Detection and Response (AI + human analysts)
- **Alert fatigue** = Too many false alerts cause analysts to miss real attacks
- **Logs** = Computer diary entries showing all activities
- My project has 5 main AI components (ATHR, CA-MICE, Compression, SOTM, Zero-Shot)

**Security Concepts Understood:**
- IP addresses can be private (internal network) or public (internet)
- Failed login attempts are warning signs
- Attackers use multiple IPs to hide their tracks
- Time patterns reveal suspicious behavior

**Challenges:**
- Understanding how AI can predict attacker behavior
- Grasping correlation between multiple IPs

**Solutions:**
- Used real-world analogies (mall security, organized crime)
- Broke down each component into simple terms

**Key Takeaway:**
"My system reads logs, finds suspicious behavior using AI reasoning, connects related attacks from multiple sources, learns from analyst feedback, and shows intelligent alerts in a web dashboard."

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Start Project 1: Log Reader System
- [ ] Create sample log files
- [ ] Learn basic Python file reading
- [ ] Understand log file formats

**Time Spent:** 4 hours

**Mood:** 😊 Excited! I understand the big picture now.

**GitHub Activity:** 
- Created repository
- Added PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- Started PROGRESS_LOG.md

## Week 1: Foundation & Project 1

## Day 1: Basic Log Reading ✅
**Date:** January 20, 2026

### What I Built:
- ✅ Created project structure
- ✅ Implemented `LogReader` class
- ✅ Added sample `auth.log` with SSH/sudo events
- ✅ Built `read_logs()` method for file I/O
- ✅ Built `print_logs()` method with formatting

### Code Created:
- `src/log_reader/parser.py` - Main log reader class
- `data/sample_logs/auth.log` - Test data

### What I Learned:
- Python file I/O with `open()` and `readlines()`
- Exception handling with try/except
- Class-based programming
- String formatting with f-strings
- Working with Linux log formats

### Challenges:
- Understanding proper file paths
- Setting up git workflow between web and local

### Testing:
```bash
python3 src/log_reader/parser.py
# Output: Successfully read 10 lines ✅
```
## Day 2: Log Format Analysis ✅
**Date:** January 21, 2026

### What I Built:
- ✅ `analyze_log_line()` - Breaks log into components
- ✅ `show_log_patterns()` - Shows common log formats
- ✅ `LogStatistics` class - Calculates file metrics
- ✅ Analyzed all 10 lines from auth.log

### Key Learning:
**Log Structure:**
```
[Timestamp] [Hostname] [Process] [Message]
Jan 19 10:23:15 server sshd[12345]: Failed password...
```

**Log Types Identified:**
1. **SSH Authentication** - Failed/Accepted login attempts
2. **Firewall Events** - UFW blocks from external IPs
3. **Sudo Commands** - Privilege escalation activities

### Code Files:
- `src/log_reader/utils.py` - Main analyzer
- `data/formatted_auth.log` - Output of the analyzer file

### Statistics from Sample Logs:
- Total entries: 10
- Failed SSH attempts: 4
- Successful logins: 2
- Sudo commands: 1
- Firewall blocks: 1
