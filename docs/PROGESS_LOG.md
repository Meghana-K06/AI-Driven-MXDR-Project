## Week 1: Foundation & Project 0

### Day 1 - January 19, 2026 ✅

**Project Phase:** Project 0 - Understanding the Problem

**What I Did:**
- Read project documentation
- Understood MXDR concepts (smart security system)
- Learned about alert fatigue problem
- Learned what logs are and why they matter
- Created GitHub repository
- Wrote PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md in my own words

**What I Learned:**
- **MXDR** = Managed Extended Detection and Response (AI + human analysts)
- **Alert fatigue** = Too many false alerts cause analysts to miss real attacks
- **Logs** = Computer diary entries showing all activities
- My project has 5 main AI components (ATHR, CA-MICE, Compression, SOTM, Zero-Shot)

**Security Concepts Understood:**
- IP addresses can be private (internal network) or public (internet)
- Failed login attempts are warning signs
- Attackers use multiple IPs to hide their tracks
- Time patterns reveal suspicious behavior

**Challenges:**
- Understanding how AI can predict attacker behavior
- Grasping correlation between multiple IPs

**Solutions:**
- Used real-world analogies (mall security, organized crime)
- Broke down each component into simple terms

**Key Takeaway:**
"My system reads logs, finds suspicious behavior using AI reasoning, connects related attacks from multiple sources, learns from analyst feedback, and shows intelligent alerts in a web dashboard."

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Start Project 1: Log Reader System
- [ ] Create sample log files
- [ ] Learn basic Python file reading
- [ ] Understand log file formats

**Time Spent:** 4 hours

**Mood:** 😊 Excited! I understand the big picture now.

**GitHub Activity:** 
- Created repository
- Added PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- Started PROGRESS_LOG.md
